# Leaked password

Lol, my mother just gave me some new mittons and wanted to show how much I mean to hear. So she knitted her most guarded secret, her password for everything. This code is so trivial that I don't even bother explaining it. Luckily this code is totally outdated and nobody, except my mom appearently, uses it anymore...
