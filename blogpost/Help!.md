# HELP - I Call on my Fellow Hackers

## Something is up!

Christmas is getting closer by the minute, but something is very WRONG!

The information provided is confidential - but from an extremely reliable source!

Christmas is nothing without Father Santa, and I have strong evidence to suggest that he is missing!!

## What has happened you ask?

As we all know, Santa has his busiest time in December -- checking his list, visiting borderline naughty children, making presents, polishing up the Raindeers, coating the sled -- point being, he is never home...

He may never be home, but he stays in touch with the people he loves with the occational text or meme.

Now, there has been nothing but radio silence since December 1st😱

There has been no official comment on Santas whearabouts....

## What to do:

Please help! I might have doubted it - but i DO LOVE CHRISTMAS - and now it's up to us to save it!
