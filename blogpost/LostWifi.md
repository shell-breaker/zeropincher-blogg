# When the Wi-Fi Password Gets Stolen 😱

## Storyline

Ever had that sinking feeling when your Wi-Fi slows down, and you realize someone might be leeching off your connection? Well, it happened to me last week. I had a random slowdown, only to discover that someone had cracked my Wi-Fi password and was stealing bandwidth. Classic case of an "unintentional hack," but it’s a reminder how easy it is to overlook basic security.

## What Happened

I’ve been using the same Wi-Fi password for a while, and I never really thought to change it. One night, I noticed my internet was sluggish, and even my phone was struggling to load basic pages. A quick check of my router's connected devices revealed a name I didn't recognize.

After a few minutes of digging, I found the device’s MAC address, cross-referenced it, and confirmed it wasn't one of mine. Someone had cracked my password and was using my Wi-Fi without permission.

## The Fix

I immediately kicked the device off the network and changed my password to a longer, more secure one. For good measure, I also turned off WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup), which I had left enabled for convenience, but can sometimes be a weak point for attackers.

It’s a reminder to:
- Change your Wi-Fi password regularly
- Use WPA3 encryption (or at least WPA2 if you can’t)
- Turn off unnecessary features like WPS
- Check connected devices periodically to spot any unfamiliar ones

## Lesson Learned

It’s easy to get complacent, but basic network security is crucial. This little mishap gave me the nudge I needed to get my home network in shape again. I also made a mental note: don’t leave critical information like Wi-Fi passwords sitting around on sticky notes or saved in your phone.

Stay secure, folks — and change those passwords often! 🔐
