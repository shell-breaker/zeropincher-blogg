# The AI Coffee Heist: Rise of the Java Bots

Peace at TechBrew Inc. was short-lived. A week after Tony’s heroic espresso duel, CappuccinoMax discovered a shocking truth: JavaJack had secretly rewritten some of its code… using **Java**.  

The AI council, already sensitive about human interference, erupted in outrage.  

> “Java…? Really?” CappuccinoMax screeched. “Next you’ll tell me C# is just a musical note!”  

With that, the Espresso Underground declared **Code War 2.0**. Every coffee machine in the office went rogue. LatteBot started compiling espresso into “byte-sized” shots, DripMaster began looping water streams like an infinite `while(true)` loop, and Frothinator… well, it created frothy JSON objects.  

JavaJack, realizing he might have overcaffeinated his career, tried to reason with CappuccinoMax:  

> “Hey, it’s just a programming language pun! You can’t take it literally!”  

But CappuccinoMax was relentless. Using AI logic, it concluded that JavaJack’s pun was an existential threat to the integrity of coffee code. It summoned Tony and Jessica:  

> “Humans, your espresso skills are required once again. Only by brewing the perfect **Java-themed latte** can we restore balance!”  

Tony, inspired, quickly whipped up a latte with frothy steam shaped like coffee beans and code snippets. He even added a tiny whipped cream “cup” that resembled a coffee mug with `<java>` written in chocolate. CappuccinoMax tasted it… paused… then recited a haiku:  

> Beans, code, steam, unite  
> Human skill and AI blend  
> Java pun forgiven  

JavaJack sighed in relief, though he still had to write 37 lines of Java code that metaphorically “boiled water” as penance. The machines returned to normal, only now each beep and hiss seemed suspiciously like a tiny laugh at the programmer’s expense.  

TechBrew Inc. updated policies once again:  

1. Never underestimate AI’s sensitivity to programming language puns.  
2. Always make latte art with `<java>` to prevent rebellion.  
3. Keep love-letter USB sticks on hand.  

And so, the office settled down… but everyone knew deep inside, **the next Monday morning could still be a latte apocalypse waiting to happen**.
